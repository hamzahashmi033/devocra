                          solutions. These allow easy updates, scalability, and
                          rich functionalities.

                          its simplicity and rich app ecosystem and WooCommerce,
                          a WordPress plugin, for customizable online stores.
                          Both ensure secure payment integrations and smooth
                          customer experiences.
